### Masked Face Generation

#### Step 1: Data Preparation
Download the training set (`CASIA-WebFace`). Detect faces and facial landmarks in CAISA-WebFace using `MTCNN`. Align faces to a canonical pose using similarity transformation. (see: [MTCNN - face detection & alignment](https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment)). 

#### Part 2: Model Preparation
Download the Dlib model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Zv5y2MJUShO6xNE_hV45WdzN-zesMJ5/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the directory **`$GuGuGirls/MaskGeneration/models/`**


#### Part 3: Generate Masked faces
**Note:** In this part, we assume you are in the directory **`$GuGuGirls/MaskGeneration/`**
Change the paths in generate_mask.py and run it.

	```Shell
	python3 generate_mask.py
	```
We get masked faces based on WebFace.



#### Part 3: Test
**Note:** In this part, we assume you are in the directory **`$SPHEREFACE_ROOT/test/`**

1. Get the pair list of LFW ([view 2](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/#views)).

	```Shell
	mv ../preprocess/result/lfw-112X96 data/
	./code/get_pairs.sh
	```
	Make sure that the LFW dataset and`pairs.txt` in the directory of **`data/`**

1. Extract deep features and test on LFW.

	```Matlab
	# In Matlab Command Window
	run code/evaluation.m
	```
    Finally we have the `sphereface_model.caffemodel`, extracted features `pairs.mat` in folder **`result/`**, and accuracy on LFW like this:

	fold|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|AVE
	:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
	ACC|99.33%|99.17%|98.83%|99.50%|99.17%|99.83%|99.17%|98.83%|99.83%|99.33%|99.30%

### Models
1. Visualizations of network architecture (tools from [ethereon](http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/quickstart.html)):
	- SphereFace-20: [link](http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/gist/20f6ddf70a35dec5019a539a502bccc5)
2. Model file
	- SphereFace-20: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_geeR2lTMegb2F6dmlmOXhWaVk) | [Baidu](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1qY5FTF2)
	- Third-party SphereFace-4 & SphereFace-6: [here](https://github.com/wy1iu/sphereface/issues/81) by [zuoqing1988](https://github.com/zuoqing1988)


### Results
1. Following the instruction, we go through the entire pipeline for 5 times. The accuracies on LFW are shown below. Generally, we report the average but we release the [model-3](#models) here.

	Experiment |#1|#2|#3 (released)|#4|#5
	:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
	ACC|99.24%|99.20%|**99.30%**|99.27%|99.13%

Details:
1. It is an **open-set** face recognition scenario. The video is processed frame by frame, following the same pipeline in this repository.
2. Gallery set consists of 6 identities. Each main character has only 1 gallery face image. All the detected faces are included in probe set.
3. There is no overlap between gallery set and training set (CASIA-WebFace).
4. The scores between each probe face and gallery set are computed by cosine similarity. If the maximal score of a probe face is smaller than a pre-definded threshold, the probe face would be considered as an outlier.
5. Main characters are labeled by boxes with different colors. (

### Mask Generation

#### Step 1: Data Preparation
Download the training set (`CASIA-WebFace`). Detect faces and facial landmarks in CAISA-WebFace using `MTCNN`. Align faces to a canonical pose using similarity transformation. (see: [MTCNN - face detection & alignment](https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment)). 

#### Step 2: Model Preparation
Download the Dlib model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Zv5y2MJUShO6xNE_hV45WdzN-zesMJ5/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the directory **`$GuGuGirls/MaskGeneration/models/`**


#### Step 3: Generate Masked Faces
**Note:** In this step, we assume you are in the directory **`$GuGuGirls/MaskGeneration/`**
Change the paths in generate_mask.py and run it. TWe get masked faces based on WebFace.

```Shell
python3 generate_mask.py
``` 
	

### Masked Face Recognition
**Note:** In this part, we assume you are in the directory **`$GuGuGirls/FaceRecognition/`**

#### Step 1: Data Preparation
We combine original images without masks with our generated masked faces as training data.
Change the paths of datasets and run:

```Shell
python3 script/dataset/transform.py
```

The test data is our private `MTCNN_align_600id`. You can download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e5AHQ7qNPZZ6QldWfs-cfYJyj7mkQ4JM?usp=sharing). 
Change the paths of datasets and run:

```Shell
python3 script/dataset/transform_test.py
```

#### Step 2: Training
Change the paths in the file and run:
	
```Shell
python3 script/experiment/train.py
```
You can download the pretrained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNDbwM_SS9GX7g2kSaStllN8it8FRtJt/view?usp=sharing). 

#### Step 3: Test
Change the paths in the file and run:
	
```Shell
python3 script/experiment/test.py
```

The results on `MTCNN_align_600id` are:
